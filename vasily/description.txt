Data Analysis
The key aspect of ride-hailing is the price. It relies on technology to collect accurate tracking data so
that a fair price can be calculated at the end of the trip. Fortunately, our riders are quick to tell us
when they overpaid and we can use that feedback to improve our product.
Please analyze the dataset to identify top opportunities for reducing the number of overcharge
tickets and present your results. Please provide us with a PDF file/document with the findings.
Finally, you shouldn’t spend more than 8 hours on this analysis.
